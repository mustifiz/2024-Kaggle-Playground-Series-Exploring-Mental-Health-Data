# 2024 Kaggle Playground Series: Exploring Mental Health Data

**Overview**

This repository contains my submission for the 2024 Kaggle Playground Series challenge focused on exploring mental health data. The goal of this competition was to analyze survey data to identify factors that may contribute to depression.

**Data**

The dataset used in this competition consists of:

* **Demographic information:** Age, gender, etc.
* **Lifestyle factors:** Exercise habits, sleep patterns, etc.
* **Mental health symptoms:** Anxiety levels, stress levels, etc.

**Approach**

My approach to this challenge involved the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration:**
   * Visualized data distributions and correlations.
   * Identified missing values and outliers.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   * Created new features based on domain knowledge and data insights.
   * Handled categorical variables using appropriate encoding techniques.

3. **Model Selection and Training:**
   * Experiment with various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM).
   * Optimized hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   * Assessed model performance using relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC).
   * Utilized cross-validation to ensure robustness.

**Results**

My final submission achieved a **Public Score** of **0.94104** and a **Private Score** of **0.93984**. While these scores are promising, there is always room for improvement. 

**Future Work**

Potential areas for future exploration include:

* **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Explore more sophisticated feature engineering techniques, such as interaction terms and non-linear transformations.
* **Ensemble Methods:** Combine multiple models to improve overall performance.

**Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different approaches!**

**If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out.**

**Note:**

* Replace the placeholder scores with your actual scores.
* Provide more specific details about your approach and results, such as the best-performing model and feature importance.
* Add code snippets or a link to your notebook for better reproducibility.
* Consider including a visualization or two to showcase your findings.

**Additional Tips:**

* Use clear and concise language.
* Use headings and subheadings to structure your README.
* Add a link to your Kaggle profile or any relevant social media handles.
* Consider adding a section on potential ethical considerations related to mental health data analysis.

**I hope this README provides a good starting point for your GitHub repository!**
